This bot is for our Inclusive Language initiative inside Zendesk Engineering.

## Configuration

### Bot Configuration

Configuration for the bot's behavior is contained in `config.yaml`, e.x.

```yaml
# Any shared configuration between fields
shared:
  # ID of the GitHub application
  appID: &appID 123456
botConfig:
  appID: *appID
  # List of terms to look for and flag in code
  termList:
    - slave
  # Name of the check. Will appear in the status list and as the title on the 'details' page
  checkName: Inclusive Language Check
  # Check summary to set when no terms are found
  checkSuccessSummary: Looks good! ðŸ˜‡
  # Check summary to set when terms are found
  checkFailureSummary: ðŸ‘‹ exclusive language
  # Generic check details text
  checkDetails: "Language check results:"
  # Text for the title of check annotations created for each flagged term in the code
  annotationTitle: Exclusive Language
  # Text for the body of each annotation. Supports one format string [%s] which will be replaced by the flagged terms
  # found on that line
  annotationBody: |
    Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I see you used the term(s) [%s] here. This language is exclusionary for members of our community,
    please consider changing it.
clientConfig:
  appID: *appID
  # Path to the private key generated for the GitHub application
  privateKeyPath: /secrets/PRIVATE_KEY
```

### Repo-specific Configuration

Certain behaviors are configurable on a per repository basis. Add a `.github/term-check.yaml` file to your
repository based off of the following template:

```yaml
# An array of patterns following .gitignore rules (http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) specifying which files and
# directories should be ignored by the app
ignore:
  - foo
  - bar/
```
